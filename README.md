# EcoCatch
Useful tool to locate fishing sites within Ontario, and easily keep up to date with fishing regulations in your area. Made with the mission to promote sustainability and prevent overfishing. Features a UI with an interactive leaflet map, using open-source coordinate data to create overlay polygons to distinguish Ontario fishing zones. Also provides options for users to refine their search.  Waterbody data gathered in realtime from "Fish Ontario-Line", using a web-scraping macro built with Selenium. Uses Axios to handle REST API and communicate with Flask server. Submitted for Terrahacks 2024 Hackathon.
